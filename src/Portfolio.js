      Hi there, I am Aniket Mandal. I am a professional front-end web developer with 1+ years of
      professional experience. After passing my M.Tech I started my job as a Project Coordinator in
      a company named IUMS Pvt. Ltd. back in Kolkata. There I find my passion for web development.
      Soon I changed my career and came all the way to Bangalore. Here I started my job as a
      Front-end Web Developer in a startup named Balihans Software Pvt. Ltd. I started designing and
      developing the company's own product named Qnabu. As I am the only one responsible for
      designing and developing front end part of the entire application, I learned a lot of things
      by myself and became a passionate web developer. I try to learn new things each and every day
      and I feel a day without learning anything new is a day wasted.
